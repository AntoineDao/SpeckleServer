### [JS] Speckle Server
This is the Speckle Server. It coordinates **everything**. WS used for realtime event notifications, everything else is a standard REST api. 

**NOTE: This is work in progress. API is not stable, authentication & user management are not yet implemented, and there's probably some glaring problems that have yet to be identified.**

### Note: The Speckle Family
Speckle is a decentralised platform for design data communication. What does this mean? Well, Speckle sends, syncs and stores geometry and any associated metadata between various clients. We currently have .NET (sender & receiver), nodejs (receiver only) and browser (receiver only) implementations.
