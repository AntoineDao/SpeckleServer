### [JS] Speckle Server
This is the Speckle Server. It coordinates **everything**.
**NOTE: This is work in progress. API is not stable, authentication & user management are not yet implemented, and there's probably some glaring problems that have yet to be identified.**

### Note: The Speckle Family
Speckle is a decentralised platform for design data communication. What does this mean? Well, Speckle sends, syncs and stores geometry and any associated metadata between various clients (we currently have .net, nodejs and browser implementations).
